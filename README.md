This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, build and run the server:

```bash
yarn build

yarn start
```

The application runs on port 3000

### Using the app

- Visit the admin page to view the list of feedback [Admin Page](http://localhost:3000/admin/feedback)
- Click the Go to Demo button on the top left of the page to go to the feedback form page
- Once feedback has been submitted go back to the admin page to check the results

### Note

- The application has to be built in order for the application to work properly with in memory store on the server.
- No authentication was implemented on the application for simplicity purposes.
- Some of the code seen on this codebase are my codes taken from previous codebases.
